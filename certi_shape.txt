===============

certificate length <- constant length 8 bits
timestamp <- constant size 64 bits
image id <- constant size 64 bits

user id <- constant size 32 bits
user name size <- constant size 32 bits
user name <- Assumed to be 20 characters ASCII

device_key id <- constant size 32 bits
device name size <- constant size 32 bits
device name <- Assumed to be 20 characters ASCII

8 + 64 * 2 + 32 * 2 + 8 * 2 + 20 * 8 * 2 == 536 (max case in bits)

===============
device id gives on some endpoint:
1. user info
2. device specs
3. description or something?
